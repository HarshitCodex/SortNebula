1) Quick sort
It uses a divide and conquer strategy. Pick an element as pivot and then we partition the given array around the pivot point.I chose the last element as the pivot at all times. The function partition performs the following:- Given an array and an element X of arry as pivot, put X at its correct position in a sorted array and put all the samller elements before x and greater after x. Time complexity on best case in O(n) and worst case is O(n**2).
